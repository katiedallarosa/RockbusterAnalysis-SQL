## Overview
This project takes on the assumptions that I've been hired by Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a traditional movie rental company facing competition from streaming giants. My role is to spearhead the data strategy for launching their new online video rental service. Utilizing SQL, I will analyze various data points to assist with the launch strategy, providing the Rockbuster Stealth management with data-driven insights for their 2020 strategy.
